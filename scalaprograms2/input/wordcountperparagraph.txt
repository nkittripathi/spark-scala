Rupani said, “Around 90 lakh big vehicles enter Gujarat every year. If one vehicle stops for five minutes, imagine the long queue it would create and the system also has to be on the job. So, from today we are declaring its (the manual checking at checkposts) abolition. Everything will be done online. The checkposts staff will be deployed at enforcement in the state.”

He added that the checkpost system will be abolished from November 20 and everything will be done online by the vehicle owners through prior self declaration and online payment.

Rupani also said that the option of offline payment of taxes and exemption fees will be available to the transporters in case they can’t do online payment. In such a case, they will have to make the payment at the nearest RTO. Generally, Rupani said, the checkposts were collecting taxes and exemption fees for overloading and over-dimension cargo.
